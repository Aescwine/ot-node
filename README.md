### <b>What is a Decentralized Knowledge Graph?</b>
</summary>

<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/nodes.png" alt="Knowledge Asset" width="200">
</div>

There are many available definitions of a knowledge graph, therefore we will present a simplified one focused on usability, rather than completeness. The purpose of this introduction is not to be a comprehensive guide for knowledge graphs, however it aims to get you started with the basics.

A **Knowledge Graph (KG)** is a complex structure that maps the connections and relationships among various entities - be they physical, digital, event-based, or conceptual. Commonly represented as semantic networks, these graphs are leveraged by major corporations such as [Amazon](http://lunadong.com/talks/PG.pdf), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph), [Uber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3yMSl5NB_Q), and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/knowledge-graph) for a wide array of applications, including search, data integration, knowledge reasoning, recommendation engines, analytics, and diverse facets of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Key characteristics of knowledge graphs include:

- Prioritization of data connections, treating them as "first-class citizens" within the realm of linked data.
- Designed to accommodate data from diverse sources, supporting a variety of formats.
- Their data models are flexible and easily extendable, ready to adapt to the evolving nature of data and its relationships.

While knowledge graphs are typically deployed within the boundaries of a single organization to capture knowledge from various internal and external sources, we conceptualize them more broadly. We define the **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** as a global, open data structure comprised of interlinked knowledge assets, benefiting both organizations and individuals.

Unique attributes of the DKG are:

- Empowerment of decentralized applications (Dapps) with search, integration, analytics, AI, and ML capabilities across a wide range of data sources, including blockchains, IPFS, enterprise systems, web services, and personal devices.
- Elimination of the need for a central authority by leveraging decentralized infrastructure.
- Facilitation of permissionless operations within the public network.
- Utilization of decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials for access control, enabling references to private data.

This expansive approach enhances accessibility and flexibility, positioning the DKG as a powerful tool in the evolving digital landscape.

### <b>The OriginTrail DKG Architecture</b>
</summary>

<br/>

The OriginTrail tech stack is tailored to enable the discoverability, verifiability, and connectivity of physical and digital assets in a coherent Web3 data ecosystem. It meets two fundamental requirements for such an infrastructure:

- Ensuring trust via decentralized consensus.
- Utilizing semantic, verifiable asset data to represent complex real-world relationships and characteristics.

OriginTrail achieves this by incorporating two distinct types of technology into two network layers - Blockchains (trust networks) and Knowledge Graphs (semantic data networks).

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/dkg-architecture1.png" alt="DKG Architecture" width="400">
</div>

**The DKG layer (Layer 2) consists of multiple sub-layers:**

- **Consensus layer**: Implements interfaces to several blockchains hosting trusted smart contracts used to manage relations between the nodes and implement trustless protocols.
- **Network layer**: A peer-to-peer swarm of DKG nodes hosted by individuals and organizations.
- **Data layer**: Hosting the knowledge graph data, distributed across the network in separate instances of graph databases.
- **Service layer**: Implements various core & extended services like authentication, standard interfaces, and data pipelines.
- **Application layer**: Includes Dapps and traditional applications that utilize the OriginTrail DKG as part of their data flows.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/dkg-architecture2.png" alt="DKG Architecture" width="400">
</div>

Further, the architecture differentiates between **the public, replicated knowledge graph** shared by all network nodes according to the protocol, and **private graphs** hosted separately by each of the networked nodes.

**The OriginTrail DKG** - combining blockchain and knowledge graph technologies - forms the backbone of the new, trusted Web3 data ecosystem. If you're a developer, you can use it to create, maintain, and use Knowledge Assets across Web3 applications, implementing standardized technologies like GS1 EPCIS, RDF/SPARQL, JSON-LD, and other W3C and GS1 standards right out of the box.

### <b>What is a Knowledge Asset?</b>
</summary>

<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/ka.png" alt="Knowledge Asset" width="200">
</div>

**Knowledge Asset is the new, AI‚Äëready resource for the Internet**

Knowledge Assets are verifiable containers of structured knowledge that live on the OriginTrail DKG and provide:
- **Discoverability - UAL is the new URL**. Consider Uniform Asset Locators (UALs) a kind of URL that identify a piece of knowledge and make it easy to find and connect with other Knowledge Assets.
- **Ownership - NFTs enable ownership**. Each Knowledge Asset is created with an NFT token that enables trusted ownership and verifiability of your knowledge.
- **Verifiability - On-chain information trail**. The blockchain tech increases trust, security, transparency, and the traceability of information.
